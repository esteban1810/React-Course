# EPISODE 3: Ternary Operators, Lists in React, CSS in React

## CSS in react
An easy way to apply styles to our components is by importing CSS file. For Example:
```
import './App.css';
```

Another way to achieve it is by using an object.
```
import styles from './App.module.css';
```

But to do this, you have to name your css file with the extension `.module.css`.
```
nombre_archivo.module.css
```
